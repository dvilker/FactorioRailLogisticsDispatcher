[entity-description]
viirld-dispatcher=A nearby station is activated in rail logistics.\nConnect the signal with the contents of the station to the input port. The input port will reflect the request to the station (with a minus sign).\nWhen the train stops, a signal with delivery information will be sent to the output port.

#from:en.txt#informatron
informatron=Rail Logistics Dispatcher [item=viirld-dispatcher] — is a small building (looks like a light bulb) that is placed\nnext to the station.\n\nThe dispatcher has two ports (visible in Alt-mode): input and output. With the help of them, the dispatcher receives information about the cargo\nat the station and transmits information about trains and deliveries.\n\nManager operating modes:\n\n[font=heading-2][item=locomotive] Depot[/font]\n\nAt the depot, trains are waiting for delivery orders.\nThe train always follows the depot with the same name from where it left, finding it by the name of the station.\n\nIf you want to have different depots for different types of trains, name them differently.\nAt the depot, the train is painted in the color of the station, and also receives a network mask.\nThe name of the depot to which the train is assigned is applied to the front locomotive.\n\nAny train arriving at the depot becomes a member of railway logistics.\nAfter completing the task, the train goes to the depot, but on the way it can receive a new task bypassing the depot.\n\nIf there is a train with cargo in the depot, it will go to the cleaning station, if there is one. If not, he will stand and wait until he is emptied.\nIf there is an empty train in the depot, it will go to the fuel station, if there is one. If not, it will stand and wait until it is refueled.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][item=rocket-fuel] Refueling[/font]\n\nIf the train's energy supply runs out (set in the settings), it goes to the nearest suitable fuel station, if there is one.\nIf there are no fuel stations, then the train will proceed to the depot, where it will wait for fuel loading.\nUsually one fuel station per surface is sufficient.\nAt the fuel station, it is recommended to refuel the train as soon as possible.\nIf the fuel station is the only station in the train schedule, then after refueling it will be sent to the nearest suitable depot, so it is convenient to build new trains at the fuel station.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][item=iron-chest] Cleaning[/font]\n\nIf the train after the task or upon arrival at the depot is not empty, it is sent to the cleaning station,\nwhere it should be completely freed from the content.\n\nIf there are no cleaning stations on the surface, the train will proceed to the depot and will not be used until it is cleared.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][item=logistic-chest-passive-provider][item=logistic-chest-requester] Supply or request[/font]\n\nDepending on the settings and material signals, the station becomes a participant in delivery tasks.\n\nFor each type of cargo (solid or liquid), the following parameters are set:\n\n[font=default-bold]Request[/font] — the amount of cargo that should be supported at the station. If not specified, it is assumed that the station\nsupplies this type of cargo.\n\n[font=default-bold]Minimum[/font] — minimum train load for this type of cargo. Trains must not run empty.\n\nYou can also configure the general mode [virtual-signal=signal-anything] — request (<0) and offer (>0) will be taken from the signal on the dispatcher's input port. To activate the general mode, a minimum must be set for a solid load and/or liquid.\n\nWhen two stations with a similar request and supply appear in the network, a delivery is created if there is a suitable train.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Net mask[/font]\n\nYou can set the net mask bit. For example:\n1 — the first network,\n2 — the second network,\n3 = 1 + 2 — both networks.\n\nFor delivery, it is necessary that the masks (bit AND) of the network at the supply station, the request station and the train intersect.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Train types[/font]\n\nOne or more types of trains allowed at this station (separated by a space).\n\nTrain type is a string where the character corresponds to the type of car (from left to right):\nL or < — locomotive directed forward,\n> — locomotive directed backwards,\nC — cargo wagon,\nF — tank,\nA — artillery.\n\nFor example:\n<CC — locomotive-car-car freight train\n<CC <FF — ...\n\nEmpty field — any type of train.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Additional functionality[/font]\n\n[font=default-bold]Turn manipulators.[/font] Supply stations have the ability to clear loaders by temporarily reversing them.\nThis greatly facilitates the creation of multi-cargo supply stations.\n\n[font=default-bold]Tamp when loading.[/font] When loading multiple goods, sometimes a situation arises that a bundle of cargo is divided into different\nwagons blocking the insertion of another cargo. This option "tamp" the pack into one of the wagons.\n\n[font=default-bold]Compound deliveries.[/font] Allows multiple types of cargo to be delivered between stations at the same time.\n\n[font=default-bold]Signal mode.[/font] Enables sending a train on a green signal at a station.\n\n[font=default-bold]Equality in the schedule.[/font] Usually, when loading, it is allowed to load more cargo (due to the size of the inserter pack).\nThis option is needed for loading accuracy.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Why do we need a dispatcher if there is an LTN?[/font]\n\nThe dispatcher is optimized for multi-item deliveries: all interfering problems have been resolved.\nIt has a friendly and intuitive interface.\nThe dispatcher is very good with blueprints.\nIn addition, the mod is published under the free MIT license.

out-need-pos=Output required content (+)
out-need-pos-tt=The output port will display the contents of the train required for shipment. For example, at the supply station, the loaded cargo will be displayed. And at the request station — empty — nothing should remain on the train.
out-exchange=Output required exchange
out-exchange-tt=The output port will display the cargo that needs to be loaded (>0) or unloaded (<0) to send the train. For example, at the supply station, the loaded cargo will be displayed with a plus sign. And at the request station — the same, but with a minus sign.

viirld-dispatcherSignalSlotCount=The number of slots for signals in the dispatcher settings. One slot is reserved for general mode.
viirld-minEnergyUseTrain=The minimum amount of charged energy in a train to be used in deliveries.\nIf, upon completion of a delivery or upon arrival at a depot, the train has less charged energy than specified in this setting, it will be directed to refuel or wait for refueling at the depot (if individual refueling no).\n\nSpecified in megajoules (MJ).
viirld-fuelScheduleTime=ВTime of inactivity in the refueling schedule (in ticks).
viirld-correctScheduleBeforeProvider=If during the journey of the train to the supply station there is an increase in supply, then the delivery can be adjusted upwards.
viirld-correctScheduleAndAtProvider=If the supply at the supply station increases while the train is being loaded, the delivery may be adjusted upwards.\n\nThis option only works if the "Adjust before supplier" option is enabled.
viirld-countingInsertersContent=When calculating the contents of stations, the incoming signal and the contents of the train are taken into account. This sometimes results in content jumps during load or unload. Because part of the cargo is in the inserters for some time. This option enables inserters content accounting.
viirld-updateTicks=The mod updates data for one cargo station per approach. Approaches are made at intervals from this setting.\nLess value — more frequent updates, more processor load.
