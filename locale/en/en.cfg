viirld-dispatcher=A nearby station is activated in rail logistics.\nConnect the signal with the contents of the station to the input port.\nWhen the train stops, a signal with delivery information will be sent to the output port.

viirld-dispatcher=Rail Logistics Dispatcher
viirld-io=Hidden port of the dispatcher

[mod-description]
viirld=Adds a dispatcher (building) to automate railway logistics based on provide and request stations.\n\nHas intuitive interface. Was inspired by LTN but went a different way.

[mod-name]
viirld=Rail Logistics Dispatcher 2(beta)

[mod-setting-description]
viirld-correctScheduleAtProvider=Upon arriving at the supply station, the delivery can be adjusted based on changes in supply and request that occurred while the train was en route to the station.
viirld-countingInsertersContent=When calculating the contents of stations, the incoming signal and the contents of the train are taken into account.\nThis sometimes results in content jumps during load or unload, because part of the cargo is in the inserters for some time.\nThis option enables inserters content accounting.
viirld-debug=Enables some debugging messages and indicators.
viirld-minEnergyUseTrainMJ=The minimum amount of charged energy in a train to be used in deliveries.\nA train with an energy reserve less than specified will not be used for deliveries; it will remain at the depot.\nSpecified in megajoules (MJ).\n\nFor example: 100 MJ = 25 coal.
viirld-updateTicks=Update station — it's a recount of its contents, settings, request, and supply.\n\nLower value — more frequent updates, more load on the CPU.\n\nNote that each station is updated no more than once every 60 ticks.
viirld-use-hack-to-save-interrupts=The lua api does not provide a way to save or change train interruptions — they are simply deleted when the schedule is changed.\n\nUntil Factorio adds such a feature, a workaround (hack) can be used.\n\nSome mods may interfere with this hack, so it may not work reliably.

EL_ITEM_ALLOW_PROVIDE=[item=passive-provider-chest] Supply
EL_ITEM_ALLOW_PROVIDE-tt=The station will supply the selected resource.\n\nThe amount of supply is determined by the signal received at the dispatcher's input port.\nIt must be connected to the station's chests and/or tanks.
EL_ITEM_ALLOW_REQUEST=[item=requester-chest] Request:
EL_ITEM_ALLOW_REQUEST-tt=The station will request the selected resource.\n\nThe request amount is determined by the specified parameter and the signal on the dispatcher input port.\nIt must be connected to the chests and/or tanks of the station.\n\nSetting the minimum will allow you to carry no less than the specified value per delivery.
EL_ITEM_BUTTON-ANY-tt=Button for settings based on signals coming into the dispatcher input port.\n\nIf a negative (< 0) cargo or fluid signal is given, the station will request this resource.\nIf positive (> 0), offer.\nIf the corresponding settings are enabled.
EL_ITEM_BUTTON-tt=Select an item or fluid, then set the request or supply parameters.\n\nThe station will request or offer the selected resource in the railway network depending on the settings.

EL_MODE_DEPOT=[item=locomotive] Depot
EL_MODE_DEPOT-tt=In the depot, trains wait for delivery tasks and refuel.\n\nA train always goes to the depot with the same name from which it left, finding it by the name of the station.\n\nIf you want to have different depots for different types of trains, name them differently.\n        \nIf a train with a small fuel supply or with cargo in the wagons, it will stand and wait until it is refueled and emptied.
EL_MODE_ENDPOINT=[item=passive-provider-chest] Supply / [item=requester-chest] Request
EL_MODE_ENDPOINT-tt=Depending on the settings and material signals, the station becomes a participant in delivery tasks.\n\nFor each type of cargo (solid or liquid), you can enable the Request or Supply mode.\n\nAlso may be configured the general mode [virtual-signal=signal-anything] - the request (<0) and offer (>0) will be taken from the signal on the dispatcher's input port.\n\nWhen two stations with a similar request and supply appear in the network, a delivery is created if there is a suitable train available.
EL_MODE_LIQUIDATION=[item=active-provider-chest] Liquidation
EL_MODE_LIQUIDATION-tt=Similar to the «[item=passive-provider-chest] Supply / [item=requester-chest] Request» mode, but with the following changes:\n- The request on this station is disabled;\n- The priority of the supply is the highest;\n- When requesting cargo from this station on other stations, it will be ignored at the minimum.\n\nUseful for to unload the cargo from the station, ready for destruction.
EL_MODE_OFF=Off
EL_MODE_OFF-tt=The dispatcher will not control this station.
EL_NETWORK=Net:
EL_NETWORK-tt=You can specify the network of this station. For example: 1, 2, ...\n\nEach network is isolated: deliveries are organized within one network. However, trains are common.
EL_OUT_MODE_EXCHANGE=Output required exchange
EL_OUT_MODE_EXCHANGE-tt=The output port will display the cargo that needs to be loaded (>0) or unloaded (<0) to send the train.\n\nFor example, the supply station will display the loaded cargo with a plus sign. And the request station will display the same, but with a minus sign.\n\nNote that the option "Negate output" can change the sign: load — <0 and unload — >0.\n\neThe following signals are also sent to the output port:\n[virtual-signal=signal-P] — When there is a train, if this is a supply station. From the word Provider.\n[virtual-signal=signal-R] — When there is a train, if this is a request station. From the word Requester.\n[virtual-signal=signal-E] — When there are any errors.\n[virtual-signal=signal-L] — Length of the train, including locomotives.\n[virtual-signal=signal-C] — Number of cargo cars.\n[virtual-signal=signal-F] — Number of tank cars.
EL_OUT_MODE_NEGATE=Negate output
EL_OUT_MODE_NEGATE-tt=Changes the sign on the output port.\n\nFor the "Output required content" mode, the train contents required for sending will be with a minus sign.\nAnd for the "Output required exchange" mode, the signs will change: load — <0 and unload — >0.
EL_OUT_MODE_TARGET_CONTENTS=Output required content
EL_OUT_MODE_TARGET_CONTENTS-tt=The output port will display the contents of the train that are required to be sent.\n\nFor example, the supply station will display the cargo being loaded. And the request station will be empty — there should be nothing left in the train.\n\neThe following signals are also sent to the output port:\n[virtual-signal=signal-P] — When there is a train, if this is a supply station. From the word Provider.\n[virtual-signal=signal-R] — When there is a train, if this is a request station. From the word Requester.\n[virtual-signal=signal-E] — When there are any errors.\n[virtual-signal=signal-L] — Length of the train, including locomotives.\n[virtual-signal=signal-C] — Number of cargo cars.\n[virtual-signal=signal-F] — Number of tank cars.
EL_ROLLBACK=Rollback
EL_STATION_TEMPLATE=Station name:
EL_STATION_TEMPLATE-tt=Template for automatic station renaming.\n\nFor the modes «[item=passive-provider-chest] Supply / [item=requester-chest] Request» or «[item=active-provider-chest] Liquidation» the field can use substitutions:\n- %d – corresponds to a number. Will be replaced with any number so that the station name becomes unique;\n- %s – corresponds to any string. Will be replaced with «blabla%d» so that the station name becomes unique;\n- %x – will be replaced with the x-coordinate of the station;\n- %y – will be replaced with the y-coordinate of the station;\n- %u – will be replaced with a unique station identifier.\n\nFor «[item=locomotive] Depot» there are no substitutions.\n\nPlease note that if the station name already matches the template, then the renaming will not occur, for example,\nif the station is already called "[item=iron-plate] Zheleznogorsk" (and there are no other stations with this name), then with the template "[item=iron-plate] %s" the renaming to "[item=iron-plate] blabla1" will not occur.\n\nExamples: \n- Template "[item=iron-plate] %d" → "[item=iron-plate] 1" or "[item=iron-plate] 2", ...\n- Template "[item=iron-plate] %s" → "[item=iron-plate] blabla1" or "[item=iron-plate] blabla2", ...\n- Template "[item=iron-plate] %xx%y" → "[item=iron-plate] 45x76"\n- Template "[item=iron-plate]" → "[item=iron-plate]1" - there is no %d or %s, so the number is added to the right.\n\nIf empty, the dispatcher does not update the station name.
