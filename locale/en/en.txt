##### mode-bidi-tt

Depending on the settings and material signals, the station becomes a participant in delivery tasks.

For each type of cargo (solid or liquid), the following parameters are set:

[font=default-bold]Request[/font] — the amount of cargo that should be supported at the station. If not specified, it is assumed that the station
supplies this type of cargo.

[font=default-bold]Minimum[/font] — minimum train load for this type of cargo. Trains must not run empty.

You can also configure the general mode [virtual-signal=signal-anything] — request (<0) and offer (>0) will be taken from the signal on the dispatcher's input port. To activate the general mode, a minimum must be set for a solid load and/or liquid.

When two stations with a similar request and supply appear in the network, a delivery is created if there is a suitable train.

##### mode-depot-tt

At the depot, trains are waiting for delivery orders.
The train always follows the depot with the same name from where it left, finding it by the name of the station.

If you want to have different depots for different types of trains, name them differently.
At the depot, the train is painted in the color of the station, and also receives a network mask.
The name of the depot to which the train is assigned is applied to the front locomotive.

Any train arriving at the depot becomes a member of railway logistics.
After completing the task, the train goes to the depot, but on the way it can receive a new task bypassing the depot.

If there is a train with cargo in the depot, it will go to the cleaning station, if there is one. If not, he will stand and wait until he is emptied.
If there is an empty train in the depot, it will go to the fuel station, if there is one. If not, it will stand and wait until it is refueled.


##### mode-fuel-tt

If the train's energy supply runs out (set in the settings), it goes to the nearest suitable fuel station, if there is one.
If there are no fuel stations, then the train will proceed to the depot, where it will wait for fuel loading.
Usually one fuel station per surface is sufficient.
At the fuel station, it is recommended to refuel the train as soon as possible.
If the fuel station is the only station in the train schedule, then after refueling it will be sent to the nearest suitable depot, so it is convenient to build new trains at the fuel station.


##### mode-clean-tt

If the train after the task or upon arrival at the depot is not empty, it is sent to the cleaning station,
where it should be completely freed from the content.

If there are no cleaning stations on the surface, the train will proceed to the depot and will not be used until it is cleared.


##### nets-tt

You can set the net mask bit. For example:
1 — the first network,
2 — the second network,
3 = 1 + 2 — both networks.

For delivery, it is necessary that the masks (bit AND) of the network at the supply station, the request station and the train intersect.


##### priority-tt

Stations with a higher priority are used for deliveries first. Both for supply stations and request stations.

In some rare cases, a supply station with a lower priority can be used instead of a higher priority — an implementation feature.


##### comps-tt

One or more types of trains allowed at this station (separated by a space).

Train type is a string where the character corresponds to the type of car (from left to right):
L or < — locomotive directed forward,
> — locomotive directed backwards,
C — cargo wagon,
F — tank,
A — artillery.

For example:
<CC — locomotive-car-car freight train
<CC <FF — ...

Empty field — any type of train.


##### informatron

Rail Logistics Dispatcher [item=viirld-dispatcher] — is a small building (looks like a light bulb) that is placed
next to the station.

The dispatcher has two ports (visible in Alt-mode): input and output. With the help of them, the dispatcher receives information about the cargo
at the station and transmits information about trains and deliveries.

Manager operating modes:

[font=heading-2]Additional functionality[/font]

[font=default-bold]Turn manipulators.[/font] Supply stations have the ability to clear loaders by temporarily reversing them.
This greatly facilitates the creation of multi-cargo supply stations.

[font=default-bold]Tamp when loading.[/font] When loading multiple goods, sometimes a situation arises that a bundle of cargo is divided into different
wagons blocking the insertion of another cargo. This option "tamp" the pack into one of the wagons.

[font=default-bold]Compound deliveries.[/font] Allows multiple types of cargo to be delivered between stations at the same time.

[font=default-bold]Signal mode.[/font] Enables sending a train on a green signal at a station.

[font=default-bold]Equality in the schedule.[/font] Usually, when loading, it is allowed to load more cargo (due to the size of the inserter pack).
This option is needed for loading accuracy.


[font=heading-2]Why do we need a dispatcher if there is an LTN?[/font]

The dispatcher is optimized for multi-item deliveries: all interfering problems have been resolved.
It has a friendly and intuitive interface.
The dispatcher is very good with blueprints.
In addition, the mod is published under the free MIT license.
